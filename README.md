Once Done Click on save

Before Configuring lets connect Jenkins with GIT using SSH


Go to your EC2 Instance & run below command

```
ssh-keygen
```

It will generate public & private key provide public key to GitHub & provide private key for Jenkins
Access the keys changing the directory to

```
cd .ssh
ls
```


Now Go to your GitHub & provide the public key as

```
cat id_rsa.pub
```

Copy that key and add to your GitHub SSH Keys Section


As you can see i have added the SSH key for the GitHub
Now similarly add private key to your Jenkins
Go to your Project -->  Configure

Check Github Project & Provide the Project URL

Now open your Instance & change Directory with

```
cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Item-Name  (todo-job1 is my Item Name)
```

Installing Node. js and npm from NodeSource

```
sudo apt install nodejs sudo apt install npm
```

Install the  requirement for .json

Now lets install docker and build the docker image by following commands

Give the commands in that docker file

Install Alpine Linux image with node 12.2.0 

```
From node:12.2.0-alpine
```
Define the working directory

```
WORKDIR app
```
Copy all the files from the project's root to /app

```
COPY . .
```
Install node_modules

```
RUN npm install
```
This tells Docker your webserver will listen on port 8080

```
EXPOSE 8080
```
CMD command specifies the instruction that is to be executed when a Docker container starts

```
CMD ["node","app.json"]
```

Add your user to the docker group / If you want to be able to skip sudo for docker commands

```
sudo usermode -a -G docker $USER
```

Reboot the docker user

```
sudo reboot
```

Launch the instance and got to Build path
Once Rebooted build Image by following Command 

```
sudo docker build . -t todo-job1
```
After Successfully image is built run the image by

```
sudo docker run -d  --name todo-job1 -p 8000:8000 todo-job1
```

Here Container-name --> todo , -d --> detached mode , -p -->Expose port 8000

To check the state of Docker

```
docker ps
```

### Step 4:-

**Now lets Run the Docker through Jenkins**
